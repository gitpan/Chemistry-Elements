NAME

  Chemistry::Elements - Perl extension for working the Chemical Elements 

SYNOPSIS

  use Chemistry::Elements qw(get_name get_Z get_symbol);

  # the constructor can use different input
  $element = new Chemistry::Elements $atomic_number;
  $element = new Chemistry::Elements $chemical_symbol;
  $element = new Chemistry::Elements $element_name;

  # you can make up your own attributes by specifying
  # a method (which is really AUTOLOAD)
        $element->molar_mass(22.989) #sets the attribute
  $MM = $element->molar_mass         #retrieves the value

  # a short demonstartion script, chart_test, is included
  # with the distribution.
  
DESCRIPTION

There are two parts to the module:  the object stuff and the
exportable functions for use outside of the object stuff. 
The exportable functions are discussed in EXPORTABLE
FUNCTIONS.

Chemistry::Elements provides an easy, object-oriented way to
keep track of your chemical data.  Using either the atomic
number, chemical symbol, or element name you can construct
an Element object.  Once you have an element object, you can
associate your data with the object by making up your own
methods, which the AUTOLOAD function handles.  Since each
chemist is likely to want to use his or her own data, or
data for some unforesee-able property, this module does not
try to be a repository for chemical data.

EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

These functions can be exported.  They are not exported by
default.

get_symbol()

	This function attempts to return the symbol of the chemical
	element given either the chemical symbol, element name, or
	atmoic number.  The function does its best to interpret
	inconsistent input data (e.g. chemcial names of mixed and
	single case).

get_name()

	This function attempts to return the name the chemical
	element given either the chemical symbol, element name, or
	atomic number.  The function does its best to interpret
	inconsistent input data (e.g. chemcial symbols of mixed and
	single case).

get_Z()

	This function attempts to return the atomic number of the
	chemical element given either the chemical symbol, element
	name, or atomic number.  The function does its best to
	interpret inconsistent input data (e.g. chemcial symbols of
	mixed and single case).
